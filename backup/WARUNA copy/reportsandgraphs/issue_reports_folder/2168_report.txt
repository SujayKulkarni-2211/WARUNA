Inspector ID: INS8
Inspector Name: Aditya S Maller
Observations: The well was not cleaned from many days
Actions Taken: I got some 50 people and cleaned it saying this is a treasure hunt and though I had called 50 people, 120 people jumped into the well and cleaned it. When they asked me the treasure I said clean water is the treasure you have now. I just said "Jal Hi Jeevan Hai" as our jal jeevan mission and now they all are paying dettol. I think we can send this to dettol and ask some commission :) don't forget my hike after that.
Recommendations: Hike
